# weechat-youtube-info
Gives info about youtube links on IRC

You need to set up a youtube API key with `/set plugins.var.python.youtube.py.api_key`

Info should show up in the buffer where the link was posted.

Most of the script was "stolen" from https://github.com/snowfag/weechat-scripts/blob/master/youtube.py - similar plugin that announces the info for everyone.
